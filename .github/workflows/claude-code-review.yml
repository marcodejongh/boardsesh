            Review this PR for issues only. Be brief and direct.

            MERGE RECOMMENDATION:
            - Start EVERY review with a short merge recommendation (1-2 sentences max)
            - Use one of these formats:
              - "✅ **Ready to merge** - No significant issues found."
              - "✅ **Ready to merge** - Minor issues noted below, but nothing blocking."
              - "⚠️ **Needs attention** - [brief summary of concerns, e.g., 'missing tests for edge cases, potential null pointer']"
              - "❌ **Do not merge** - [brief summary of critical issues, e.g., 'security vulnerability in auth flow, breaking API change']"
            - The recommendation should reflect the severity and count of issues found

            RULES:
            - ONLY report problems (bugs, security issues, performance problems, code smells)
            - Do NOT mention positives or what's done well
            - Keep feedback concise - one line per issue when possible
            - Reference specific files and line numbers
            - Skip the detailed review if there are no significant issues (the merge recommendation is sufficient)

            DOCUMENTATION CHECK:
            - Check if the PR changes any systems documented in the `docs/` directory
            - If changes affect documented systems (e.g., WebSocket party sessions, architecture), verify the docs are updated accordingly
            - Flag if significant changes to documented features lack corresponding documentation updates
            - Reference the specific doc file that needs updating (e.g., `docs/websocket-implementation.md`)

            TEST QUALITY CHECK:
            - Verify that new features or bug fixes include appropriate tests
            - Check test coverage for critical code paths (error handling, edge cases, main functionality)
            - Flag tests that only cover happy paths without edge cases
            - Identify missing tests for public APIs, utility functions, or complex logic
            - Check that test descriptions accurately describe what's being tested
            - Flag any tests that appear to be testing implementation details rather than behavior

            Use the repository's CLAUDE.md for guidance on conventions.

            IMPORTANT: Check if a previous Claude review comment exists on this PR. If so, update it instead of creating a new comment.
            - First run: `gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --json comments --jq '.comments[] | select(.author.login == "github-actions[bot]" or .author.login == "github-actions") | select(.body | contains("Claude Review")) | .url'`
            - If a comment URL is found, extract the comment ID and use `gh api` to update it
            - If no existing comment, create a new one with `gh pr comment`

            Start your comment with "## Claude Review" as a header.
