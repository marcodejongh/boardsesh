/* Responsive grid column for climbs list

   This CSS replaces antd's responsive Col props (xs/sm/lg/xl) to avoid
   JavaScript-based breakpoint detection that can cause infinite loops
   on iOS Safari when the browser UI changes viewport size.

   Since no `span` prop is set on the Col component, antd doesn't apply
   its flex rules, allowing these CSS flex properties to control the layout.
   This is intentional - we're using antd Col purely for gutter spacing
   while CSS handles the responsive column widths. */
.climbCol {
  /* Default: full width on small screens (matches previous xs={24}) */
  flex: 0 0 100%;
  max-width: 100%;
}

/* lg breakpoint (992px+): 2 columns (matches previous lg={12}) */
@media (min-width: 992px) {
  .climbCol {
    flex: 0 0 50%;
    max-width: 50%;
  }
}
