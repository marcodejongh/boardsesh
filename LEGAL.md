## What This Project Is

This is a free, open-source, community-built alternative for browsing and interacting with standardised LED climbing training boards (Kilter Board, Tension Board, MoonBoard, and others). It is non-commercial and maintained entirely by volunteers.

We believe climbers should have the freedom to choose how they interact with hardware they've purchased, and that community-created data should remain accessible to the community.

## Our Position on Climb Data

### Climbs are factual data

A climb on a standardised board is a list of hold positions on a fixed, standardised layout (e.g. "start on A5, use B12, C3, D18, finish on K11"), combined with a grade and wall angle. This is factual, functional information — comparable to a chess position, a set of GPS coordinates, or a phone number — not a creative work of authorship.

Under U.S. copyright law, **facts are not copyrightable** (*Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co.*, 499 U.S. 340 (1991)). A standardised board with a finite number of holds (typically 200–500) produces climb definitions that are inherently constrained, factual, and functional.

### The database is community-created

The climb databases for these boards are almost entirely **user-generated content**. Individual climbers create and submit climbs. The board manufacturers did not author this content — they provide a platform for submission and display.

Under standard terms of service for platforms hosting user-generated content, users typically grant the platform a **non-exclusive license** to display their submissions. This license does not transfer ownership of the content to the platform, nor does it give the platform the right to prevent third parties from independently collecting or presenting the same factual data.

### Comprehensive databases have weak compilation protection

Even where a database *arrangement* might qualify for thin copyright protection as a compilation, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that protection extends only to creative selection or arrangement — not to the underlying facts. A database that comprehensively collects *all* user submissions without editorial curation (as these platforms do) is analogous to an alphabetical phone directory, which the Court found unprotectable in *Feist*.

## Attribution & Respect for Creators

We respect the climbing community and the people who create climbs.

- Where climb creator information is available, we attribute the creator by their username.
- We do not claim authorship of climbs we did not create.
- If you are the creator of a climb and would like it removed from this project, please open an issue or contact us and we will honour your request promptly.

## Interoperability & Hardware Compatibility

This project provides software that is compatible with standardised climbing board hardware. Climbers who have purchased these boards have a right to use third-party software with their own hardware.

We use board and product names (e.g. "Kilter Board", "MoonBoard", "Tension Board") solely to describe hardware compatibility and interoperability. These names are trademarks of their respective owners. This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Aurora Climbing, Moon Climbing, or any board manufacturer.

## DMCA & Takedown Requests

We take intellectual property concerns seriously. If you believe any material in this project infringes your copyright, please contact us with the following information:

1. Identification of the copyrighted work you believe is infringed.
2. Identification of the material you believe is infringing, with enough detail for us to locate it.

## A Note to the Community

The climbing community has a long tradition of openly sharing beta. This project exists in that spirit. We are not trying to harm any company — we are trying to give climbers better tools to interact with hardware they already own and data they helped create.

If you are a board manufacturer and would like to discuss collaboration or have concerns, we welcome open dialogue. Please reach out.
