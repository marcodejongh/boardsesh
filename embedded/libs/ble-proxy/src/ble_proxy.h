/**
 * BLEProxy orchestrates the proxy connection between official app and Aurora board.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - Acts as a BLE server (appears as "Kilter Boardsesh" to official app)
 * - Acts as a BLE client to the actual Aurora board
 * - Forwards all data bidirectionally
 *
 * State Machine:
 *   DISABLED → IDLE → SCANNING → CONNECTING → CONNECTED
 *                                     ↑            ↓
 *                                     └── RECONNECTING ←┘
 *
 * Usage:
 * 1. Call begin() with a target MAC or empty string for auto-detect
 * 2. Call loop() regularly to process state
 * 3. Data received from app is forwarded to board
 * 4. Data received from board is forwarded to app
