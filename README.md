## Our Vision

LED climbing boards like Kilter, Tension, Moonboard, Decoy, and Grasshopper have revolutionized indoor training. We believe the climbing community deserves a centralized platform that brings all these boards together—making it easier to track progress, train with friends, and get the most out of your board.

Boardsesh is a unified experience that works across different board types, helping you focus on what matters most—climbing.

## What Boardsesh Offers

- **Queue management** — Coordinate climbs when training with others
- **Real-time collaboration** — Share sessions with friends via Party Mode
- **Multi-board support** — One app for Kilter, Tension, and more
- **Active development** — New features and improvements from the community
- **Self-hosting option** — Run your own instance if you prefer

## Open Source

Boardsesh is completely open source under the Apache license. You can view the code, contribute features, report bugs, or fork it entirely to run your own instance.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for development setup instructions.

## API Documentation

Building something cool with climbing data? We provide a public API that developers can use to access climb information and build their own integrations. [Explore the API Documentation →](https://www.boardsesh.com/docs)
